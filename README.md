# DevLink â€” Linktree

A React application for link management, inspired by the Linktree concept. With DevLink, you can organize, manage, and share your links in a practical and intuitive way.

## Features

- **Link Management**: Create, edit, and delete links easily, keeping everything organized.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Use React Router DOM for a smooth navigation experience between pages.
- **Secure Authentication**: Protected access and user management through Firebase.
- **Responsive Interface**: Modern and responsive design with TailwindCSS, ensuring a consistent experience on all devices.

## How It Works

1. The user authenticates (or registers) using Firebase Authentication.
2. After logging in, the user gains access to the management panel, where they can create, edit, and delete links.
3. The link data is synchronized with the real-time database, enabling a complete CRUD functionality.
4. The application's navigation is managed by React Router DOM, providing an intuitive and organized user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: For managing routes and navigation between pages.
- **TailwindCSS**: A CSS framework for styling and responsive design.
